                    <span> 1. Introduction to Web Design</span> <br>
                    Web design is the process of creating and styling websites to ensure they are visually appealing,
                    user-friendly, and functional. <br> It combines design principles with technical skills to deliver a
                    smooth user experience (UX). Good web design ensures a website is responsive, accessible, and
                    engaging for users. <br>
                    <span> 2. Key Elements of Web Design</span> <br>
                    <b>Layout & Structure</b> <br>
                    The layout determines how elements are arranged on a webpage. It should be structured logically for
                    easy navigation and user interaction. <br>
                    <b>Color Scheme & Typography</b> <br>
                    Colors influence emotions and brand identity. Typography (font style and size) impacts readability
                    and aesthetics. <br>
                    <b> Navigation</b> <br>
                    A website should have an intuitive navigation system, including menus, links, and buttons to help
                    users move between pages easily. <br>
                    <b>Responsiveness</b> <br>
                    Websites should adapt to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) using responsive design
                    techniques like flexible grids and media queries. <br>
                    <b> User Experience (UX) & Accessibility</b> <br>
                    Websites should be easy to use and accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. This
                    involves clear layout, readable text, and compatibility with assistive technologies. <br>
                    <span> Web Design Process</span> <br>
                    The web design process follows a structured approach to ensure efficiency and effectiveness: <br>
                    <b>Planning</b> <br>
                    Define the website’s purpose, target audience, and structure. Create a sitemap for content
                    organization. <br>
                    <b> Wireframing & Prototyping</b> <br>
                    Wireframes are sketches of the website layout, while prototypes provide an interactive mockup before
                    development. <br>
                    <b> Designing</b> <br>
                    Apply UI/UX principles, including colors, fonts, and images, to create an engaging interface. <br>
                    <b> Development</b> <br>
                    Convert design into a functional website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks like Bootstrap
                    or Tailwind CSS speed up the process. <br>
                    <b> Testing & Deployment</b> <br>
                    Test for responsiveness, compatibility, and performance. Fix errors before launching the website.
                    <br>
                    <span> Web Design Tools & Technologies</span> <br>
                    <b> Coding Languages</b> <br>
                    HTML (structure), CSS (styling), and JavaScript (interactivity) are the core web technologies. <br>
                    <b>UI/UX Design Tools</b> <br>
                    Figma, Adobe XD, and Sketch help design website interfaces before development.
                    <b>Frameworks & Libraries</b> <br>
                    Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and Material UI provide pre-designed components for faster development.
                    <br>
                    <span>Trends in Web Design</span> <br>
                    - <b>Minimalist & Dark Mode Designs:</b> Clean, simple designs with dark mode options. <br>
                    - <b>AI-powered and Interactive UI</b>: AI chatbots, animations, and microinteractions. <br>
                    - <b>Mobile-first Approach:</b> Designing for mobile devices before desktops. <br>
                    - <b>Accessibility & Inclusivity:</b> Making websites usable for all individuals, including those
                    with
                    disabilities.

                    <span> Definition of Statistics: </span> <br>
                    We can define statistics in two ways / Senses.
                    <br>
                    1.
                    <span>Plural sense (lay man definition). </span><br>
                    ✓ Statistics is an aggregate or collection of numerical facts. <br>
                    ✓ Statistics are the raw data themselves, like statistics of births, statistics of deaths,
                    statistics
                    of students, statistics of imports and exports, etc. <br>
                    <span>2. Singular sense (formal definition)</span> <br>
                    Statistics is defined as a science of collecting, organizing, presenting, analyzing and interpreting
                    statistical data. <br>
                    <span> Classifications of Statistics: </span>- <br>
                    Depending on how data can be used, statistics is sometimes divided in to two main areas or
                    branches these are : <br>
                    <span> 1.Descriptive Statistics:</span> <br>is concerned with summary calculations, graphs, charts
                    and tables. <br>
                    Examples:
                    ➢ National census conducted by the Sierra Leone government every ten (10) years. <br>
                    <span> 2. Inferential Statistics:</span> <br>is a method used to generalize from a sample to a
                    population.
                    For example, the average income of all families (the population) in Sierra Leone can be
                    estimated from figures obtained from a few hundred (the sample) families. <br>
                    i. It is important because statistical data usually arises from sample. <br>
                    ii. Statistical techniques based on probability theory are required. <br>
                    iii. Inferential statistics is based on probability theory <br>



                    <span> Stages in Statistical Investigation</span> <br>
                    There are five stages or steps in any statistical investigation. <br>

                    <span> 1.Collection of data:</span> the process of measuring, gathering, assembling the raw data up
                    on which the
                    statistical investigation is to be based. Data can be collected in a variety of ways; one of the
                    most
                    common methods is through the use of survey.
                    Survey can also be done in different methods, three of the most common methods are: <br>
                    - Telephone survey <br>
                    - Mailed questionnaire <br>
                    - Personal interview. <br>
                    <span>2. Organization of data</span> <br>
                    Summarization of data in some meaningful way, e.g table form <br>
                    <span> 3. Presentation of the data:</span> <br>is the process of re-organization, classification,
                    compilation, and
                    summarization of data to present it in a meaningful form. The main purpose of data presentation is
                    to facilitate statistical analysis. Graphs and diagrams may also be used to give the data a valid
                    meaning
                    and make the presentation attractive <br>
                    <span> 4. Analysis of data:</span> The process of extracting relevant information from the
                    summarized data, mainly
                    through the use of elementary mathematical operation. This is the stage where we critically study
                    the
                    data to draw conclusions about the population parameter. The purpose of data analysis is to dig out
                    information useful for decision making. <br>
                    <span> 5. Inference of data:</span> <br> The interpretation and further observation of the various
                    statistical measures
                    through the analysis of the data by implementing those methods by which conclusions are formed and
                    inferences made. <br> -
                    Statistical techniques based on probability theory are required. <br>
                    <span> Definitions of some basic terms</span> <br>
                    <span>a. Statistical Population:</span> <br>It is the collection of all possible observations of a
                    specified
                    characteristic of
                    interest (possessing certain common property) and being under study. An example is all of the
                    students in UNIMTECH. <br>
                    <span> b. Sample:</span> <br> It is a subset of the population, selected using some sampling
                    technique in such a way
                    that
                    they represent the population. <br>
                    <span>c. Sampling: </span> <br>The process or method of sample selection from the population. <br>
                    <span> d. Sample size:</span> <br> The number of elements or observation to be included in the
                    sample. <br>
                    <span>e. Census:</span> <br> Complete enumeration or observation of the elements of the population.
                    Or it is the
                    collection
                    of data from every element in a population <br>
                    <span> f. Parameter:</span> <br> Characteristic or measure obtained from a population. <br>
                    <span> g. Statistic:</span> <br> Characteristic or measure obtained from a sample. <br>
                    <span> h. Variable:</span> <br>It is an item of interest that can take on many different numerical
                    values. <br>
                    <span>Types of Variables</span> <br>
                    1 Qualitative Variables are non-numeric variables and can't be measured. Examples include gender,
                    religious affiliation, Residence and the like. <br>
                    2 Quantitative Variables are numerical variables and can be measured. Examples include balance in
                    checking account, number of children in family. <br>
                    ❖ Note that quantitative variables are either discrete (which can assume only certain values, and
                    there
                    are usually "gaps" between the values, such as the number of bedrooms in your house) or
                    continuous (which can assume any value within a specific range, such as the air pressure in a tire.)
                    <br>
                    ❖ Quantitative variables can be further classified into two groups: discrete and continuous.
                    Discrete variables can be assigned values such as 0, 1, 2, 3, … are said to be countable.
                    Examples of discrete variables are the number of children in a family, the number of students in a
                    classroom. <br>
                    <span> Discrete variables</span> assume values that can be counted. <br>
                    <span> Continuous variables,</span> by comparison, can assume an infinite number of values in an
                    interval
                    between any two specific values. For example, Temperature is a continuous variable, since the
                    variable can assume an infinite number of values between any two given temperatures. <br>
                    <span>Continuous variables</span> can assume an infinite number of values between any two specific
                    values. <br>
                    • They are obtained by measuring. <br>
                    • They often include fractions and decimals. <br>
                    <span>Applications, Uses and Limitations of statistics</span> <br>
                    <span> Applications of statistics:</span> <br>
                    1. In almost all fields of human endeavor. <br>
                    2. Almost all human beings in their daily life are subjected to obtaining numerical facts e.g. about
                    price <br>
                    3. Applicable in some process e.g. invention of certain drugs, extent of environmental pollution.
                    <br>
                    4. In industries especially in quality control area. <br>
                    <span> Uses of statistics:</span>
                    The main function of statistics is to enlarge our knowledge of complex phenomena. <br>
                    The following are some uses of statistics: <br>
                    1.
                    It presents facts in a definite and precise form. <br>
                    2. Data reduction. <br>
                    3. Measuring the magnitude of variations in data. <br>
                    4. Estimating unknown population characteristics. <br>
                    5. Testing and formulating of hypothesis. <br>
                    6. Studying the relationship between two or more variables. <br>
                    7. Forecasting future events. <br>
                    <span> Limitations of statistics</span> <br>
                    As a science statistics has its own limitations. The following are some of the limitations: <br>
                    - Deals with only quantitative information. <br>
                    - Deals with only aggregate of facts and not with individual data items. <br>
                    - Statistical data are only approximately and not mathematical correct. <br>
                    - Statistics can be easily misused and therefore should be used be experts. <br>
                    <span>Scales of measurement</span> <br>
                    Proper knowledge about the nature and type of data to be deal with is essential in order to specify
                    and
                    apply the proper statistical method for their analysis and inferences. Measurement scale refers to
                    the
                    property of value assigned to the data based on the properties of order, distance and fixed zero.
                    <br>
                    <span> SCALE TYPES</span> <br>
                    Measurement is the assignment of numbers to objects or events in a systematic fashion. Four levels
                    of
                    measurement scales are commonly distinguished: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio and each
                    possessed
                    different properties of measurement systems. <br>
                    <span>Nominal Scales</span>
                    1.
                    Qualities with no ranking or ordering, no numerical or quantitative value. <br>
                    2. These types of data are consisting of names, labels and categories. <br>
                    <span>Nominal scales</span> are measurement systems that possess none of the three properties that
                    is order,
                    distance
                    and fixed zero. <br>
                    1.
                    Level of measurement which classifies data into mutually exclusive, all-inclusive categories in
                    which no order or ranking can be imposed on the data. <br>
                    2. No arithmetic (+,-, x, /) and relational (<,>, =, ≤, ≥, ≠) operation can be applied. <br>
                        <span> Examples:</span> <br>
                        ✓ Political party preference (Republican, Democrat, or Other,) <br>
                        ✓ Sex (Male or Female.) <br>
                        ✓ Marital status (married, single, widowed, divorced) <br>
                        ✓ Country code (+251, +1, … <br>
                        ✓ Regional differentiation of Ethiopia. <br>
                        <span>Ordinal Scales</span> <br>
                        Ordinal Scales are measurement systems that possess the property of order or rank, but not the
                        property
                        of distance. The property of fixed zero is not important if the property of distance is not
                        satisfied. <br>
                        • Level of measurement which classifies data into categories that can be ranked. <br>
                        Differences between the ranks do not exist. <br>
                        • Arithmetic operations are not applicable but relational operations (<,>, =, ≤, ≥, ≠) are
                            applicable. <br>
                            • Ordering is the sole property of ordinal scale. <br>
                            Examples: <br>
                            • Letter grades (A, B, C, D, F). <br>
                            • Rating scales (Excellent, Very good, Good, Fair, poor). <br>
                            <span>Sources of Data </span><br>
                            There are two sources of data; these are primary and secondary sources of data. <br>
                            <span> Primary sources:</span> are sources where the data is measured or collected by the
                            investigator or
                            the user directly
                            from the source. <br>
                            <span>Secondary sources:</span> are sources where the data is not measured or not collected
                            by the
                            investigator or the
                            user directly from the source. <br>
                            <span> Methods of Data Presentation</span> <br>
                            Having collected and edited the data, the next important step is to organize it. That is to
                            present it in a
                            readily comprehensible condensed form that aids in order to draw inferences from it. It is
                            also necessary
                            that the like be separated from the unlike ones. The presentation of data is broadly
                            classified in to the
                            following two categories: <br>
                            1.Tabular presentation <br>
                            2.Diagrammatic and Graphic presentation. <br>


                            The process of arranging data in to classes or categories according to similarities
                            technically is called
                            classification. <br>
                            Classification is a preliminary and it prepares the ground for proper presentation of data.
                            <br>
                            <span> Definitions:</span> <br>
                            1.
                            <span>Raw data:</span> recorded information in its original collected form, whether it is
                            counts or

                            <span> Frequency distributions:</span> <br>
                            There are three basic types of frequency distributions
                            1.
                            Categorical frequency distribution <br>
                            2. Ungrouped frequency distribution <br>
                            3. Grouped frequency distribution <br>
                            There are specific procedures for constructing each type.

            <div class="research-notes">
                <p> <span>Introduction to Research Methods</span> <br>
                    The Word <b>‘Research’ </b>is comprises of two words = <b>Re+Search.</b> It means to search again.
                    So
                    research means a systematic investigation or activity to gain new knowledge of the already
                    existing facts. <br>
                    <b>Research </b>is an intellectual activity. It is responsible for bringing to light new knowledge.
                    It is
                    also responsible for correcting the present mistakes, removing existing misconceptions and
                    adding new learning to the existing fund of knowledge. Researches are considered as a
                    combination of those activities which are removed from day to day life and are pursued by
                    those persons who are gifted in intellect and sincere in pursuit of knowledge. But it is not
                    correct to say that the research is restricted to such type of persons, however, it is correct to
                    say that major contribution of research comes from highly gifted and committed workers.
                    Thus the research is not at all mysterious and is carried on by hundreds of thousands of
                    4
                    average individuals <b>Gabriel, T. (2006).</b> <br>
                    <span>Definition Of Research</span> <br>
                    “Research is an honest, exhaustive, intelligent searching for facts and
                    their meanings or implications with reference to a given problem. The
                    product or findings of a given piece of research should be an
                    authentic, verifiable contribution to knowledge in the field studied.”
                    <b>.M. Cook, 1981.</b> <br>
                    <span> Importance of Research</span> <br>
                    Research is a fundamental process that drives knowledge, innovation, and problem-solving
                    in various fields. It is important for a wide range of reasons, as it contributes to the
                    advancement of science, society, and industry. Below are the key reasons why research is
                    important, supported by examples: <br>
                    <span> 1. Advancement of Knowledge</span> <br>
                    Research expands our understanding of the world by discovering new facts, theories,
                    or insights. It allows us to build on existing knowledge and continually improve our
                    understanding of various subjects.
                    Example: Medical research, such as studies on the human genome or cancer
                    therapies, can lead to groundbreaking discoveries that improve our understanding of
                    diseases, which can result in better treatments or even cures. <br>
                    <span> 2. Solving Problems</span> <br>
                    One of the primary purposes of research is to find solutions to real-world problems.
                    Research allows for the identification of issues, the exploration of potential causes,
                    and the development of effective solutions. <br>
                    Example: Research on climate change and its effects has led to the development of
                    renewable energy technologies, such as solar panels and wind turbines, which help
                    address global energy and environmental challenges. <br>

                    <span> 3. Informed Decision Making</span> <br>
                    Research provides evidence-based insights that help individuals, organizations, and governments make
                    better decisions. Policy decisions, business strategies, and even personal choices are often guided
                    by
                    research findings. <br>
                    Example: Government policies related to public health (e.g., COVID-19 measures) are often based on
                    research and data gathered from medical and social science studies <br>
                    <span>4. Innovation and Technological Advancement</span> <br>
                    Research fosters innovation by exploring new ideas and technologies. It often leads to the
                    development of new products, services, and technologies that can improve quality of life and drive
                    economic growth. <br>
                    Example: Research in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning has led to
                    innovations
                    such as voice assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa), autonomous vehicles, and advancements in personalized
                    medicine. <br>
                    <span>5. Improving Existing Practices</span> <br>
                    Through research, existing methods, practices, or technologies can be refined, improved, and
                    optimized. This is essential for enhancing efficiency, quality, and effectiveness in various fields.
                    <br>
                    Example: In education, research on teaching methods and learning processes has led to the
                    development of more effective pedagogical strategies, such as differentiated instruction, flipped
                    classrooms, and the use of technology in the classroom. <br>
                    <span> 6. Economic Growth and Development</span> <br>
                    Research is a key driver of economic growth. It creates new industries, improves productivity, and
                    opens new markets. By investing in research and development (R&D), nations and organizations can
                    foster economic growth and competitiveness. <br>
                    Example: Pharmaceutical companies invest heavily in research to develop new drugs, which can lead to
                    the creation of new markets and industries. The development of new drugs like the COVID-19 vaccines
                    created entire new industries focused on global distribution and manufacturing.
                    <span> 7. Evidence-based Policy and Social Change</span> <br>
                    Research is crucial for formulating public policies that address societal issues. Social science
                    research, in
                    particular, provides insights into areas like education, poverty, and inequality, helping
                    policymakers
                    design more effective programs and interventions. <br>
                    Example: Research on the effects of early childhood education has influenced educational policies in
                    many countries, leading to reforms that prioritize preschool education as a means to improve long
                    term academic and social outcomes for children. <br>
                    <span>8. Building Credibility and Trust</span> <br>
                    Research provides a basis for credibility in various fields. By conducting and publishing research,
                    professionals, academics, and organizations can establish their expertise, which builds trust and
                    authority in their field. <br>
                    Example: Academic researchers and institutions build credibility through peer-reviewed publications,
                    which signal the validity and reliability of their findings, thus earning the trust of the academic
                    community and the public. <br>
                    <span>Characteristics Of Research</span> <br>
                    Following are the characteristics of research; <br>
                    i.Research is directed toward the solution of a problem. <br>
                    ii.Research requires expertise. <br>
                    iii.Research emphasizes the development of generalizations,




                    principles, or theories that will be helpful in predicting future
                    occurrences.
                    evidences. <br>
                    iv. Research is based upon observable experience or empirical <br>
                    v. Research demands accurate observation and description. <br>
                    vi. Research involves gathering new data from primary or first-hand
                    sources or using existing data for a new purpose. <br>
                    <span>Types Of Research</span> <br>
                    Research can broadly be divided into two types: Qualitative Research and
                    Quantitative Research. These approaches differ in their methods, objectives, and
                    data types. <br>
                    <b>Qualitative research</b> is an approach that seeks to understand phenomena from a
                    deep, subjective perspective, focusing on exploring experiences, perceptions, and the
                    meanings people attach to them. It typically deals with non-numerical data, such as
                    words, images, or observations. <br>
                    <b>Quantitative research </b>is an approach that focuses on gathering
                    numerical data and applying statistical methods to quantify variables,
                    measure relationships, and identify patterns or trends. It aims to answer
                    questions about how much, how many, or to what extent phenomena
                    occur.

                    <span> What is computer Network?</span> <br>
                    A communication system for connecting computers/hosts. <br>
                    • A computer network is a number of computers ( also known as nodes) connected by some
                    communication lines. <br>
                    • Two computers connected to the network can communicate with each other through the other nodes if
                    they are not directly connected. <br>

                    Communication is almost as important to us as our reliance on air, food, water and shelter. The
                    methods
                    that we
                    used to share the information are constantly changing and evolving. As with every advance in
                    communication
                    technology, the creation and interconnection of data network is having a profound effect. These days
                    computer
                    networks have evolved to carry voice, video streams, text and graphics between many different types
                    of
                    devices.
                    The immediate nature of communications over the Internet encourages the formation of global
                    communities.
                    These communities foster social interaction that is independent of location or time zone. <br>

                <p>
                    <span>What is Data Communication</span> <br>
                    Data Communication is a process of exchanging data or
                    information <br>
                    In case of computer networks this exchange is done between
                    two devices over a transmission medium. <br>
                    This process involves a communication system which is made
                    up of hardware and software. The hardware part involves the
                    sender and receiver devices and the intermediate devices
                    through which the data passes. The software part involves
                    certain rules which specify what is to be communicated, how it
                    is to be communicated and when. It is also called as a Protocol. <br>
                    The following sections describes the fundamental
                    characteristics that are important for the effective working of
                    data communication process and is followed by the components
                    that make up a data communications system. <br>
                    <span> Characteristics of Data Communication </span> <br>
                    The effectiveness of any data communications system depends
                    upon the following four fundamental characteristics: <br>
                    1. Delivery: The data should be delivered to the correct
                    destination and correct user. <br>
                    2. Accuracy: The communication system should deliver the data
                    accurately, without introducing any errors. The data may get
                    corrupted during transmission affecting the accuracy of the
                    delivered data. <br>
                    3. Timeliness: Audio and Video data has to be delivered in a
                    timely manner without any delay; such a data delivery is called
                    real time transmission of data. <br>
                    4. Jitter: It is the variation in the packet arrival time. Uneven Jitter
                    may affect the timeliness of data being transmitted. <br>
                    <span>Components of Data Communication</span> <br>
                    A Data Communication system has five components as
                    shown in the diagram below: <br>
                    1. Message
                    Message is the information to be communicated by the sender to
                    the receiver. <br>
                    2. Sender
                    The sender is any device that is capable of sending the data
                    (message). <br>
                    3. Receiver
                    The receiver is a device that the sender wants to communicate the
                    data (message). <br>
                    4. Transmission Medium
                    It is the path by which the message travels from sender to receiver.
                    It can be wired or wireless and many subtypes in both. <br>
                    5. Protocol

                    It is an agreed upon set or rules used by the sender and
                    receiver to communicate data.
                    A protocol is a set of rules that governs data communication.
                    A Protocol is a necessity in data communications without
                    which the communicating entities are like two persons trying
                    to talk to each other in a different language without know the
                    other language. <br>
                    <span>DATA REPRESENTATION </span> <br>
                    Data is collection of raw facts which is processed to deduce
                    information. <br>
                    There may be different forms in which data may be represented.
                    Some of the forms of data used in communications are as follows: <br>
                    <b> 1. Text</b> <br>
                    Text includes combination of alphabets in small case as well
                    as upper case.
                    It is stored as a pattern of bits. Prevalent encoding system :
                    ASCII, Unicode <br>
                    <b>2. Numbers </b><br>
                    Numbers include combination of digits from 0 to 9.
                    It is stored as a pattern of bits. Prevalent encoding system :
                    ASCII, Unicode <br>
                    <b> 3. Images</b> <br>―An image is worth a thousand words‖ is a very famous saying.
                    In computers images are digitally stored.
                    A Pixel is the smallest element of an image. To put it in simple
                    terms, a picture or image is a matrix of pixel elements.
                    The pixels are represented in the form of bits. Depending upon
                    the type of image (black n white or color) each pixel would
                    require different number of bits to represent the value of a pixel.
                    The size of an image depends upon the number of pixels (also
                    called resolution) and the bit pattern used to indicate the value
                    of each pixel. <br>
                    Example: if an image is purely black and white (two color) each
                    pixel can be represented by a value either 0 or 1, so an image
                    made up of 10 x 10 pixel elements would require only 100 bits in
                    memory to be stored. <br>
                    On the other hand an image that includes gray may require 2
                    bits to represent every pixel value (00 - black, 01 – dark gray, 10
                    5 – light gray, 11 –white). So the same 10 x 10 pixel image would
                    now require 200 bits of memory to be stored.
                    Commonly used Image formats : jpg, png, bmp, etc <br>
                    <b> 4. Audio</b> <br>
                    Data can also be in the form of sound which can be recorded
                    and broadcasted. Example: What we hear on the radio is a
                    source of data or information.
                    Audio data is continuous, not discrete. <br>
                    <b> 5. Video</b> <br>
                    Video refers to broadcasting of data in form of picture or movie

                    <span>1. Introduction to C++</span> <br>
                    C++ is a powerful, high-performance programming language that extends the C language with
                    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) features. <br>
                    Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s, C++ is widely used in system programming,
                    game development, and software engineering. <br>
                    <span>Key Features of C++:-</span> <br> Fast and Efficient: Provides direct memory manipulation.
                    <br>-
                    Object-Oriented: Supports classes, inheritance, and polymorphism. <br>- Portable: Can be compiled
                    and run on different platforms. <br>- Extensible: Allows for the development of complex software
                    systems. <br>
                    <span>Basic Structure of a C++ Program:</span> <br>
                    cpp
                    #include < iostream> <br>
                        using namespace std; <br>
                        int main() { <br>
                        cout << "Hello, World!" ; <br> return 0; <br> } <br>
                            <span> 2. Basic Syntax & Data Types</span> <br>C++ supports various data
                            types: <br>- int: Stores integers (e.g., 5, -2) <br>- float: Stores decimal numbers (e.g.,
                            3.14) <br>- char: Stores single characters (e.g., 'A' , 'B' ) <br>- string: Stores text
                            (requires < string> library) <br>- bool: Stores true/false values <br>
                                Example: <br>
                                cpp
                                int age = 25; <br>
                                float pi = 3.14; <br>
                                char grade = 'A'; <br>
                                string name = "John"; <br>
                                bool isPassed = true; <br>

                                <span> 3. Control Statements (Loops & Conditions)</span> <br>
                                C++ supports conditional statements (if-else) and loops (for, while, do-while). <br>
                                Example of if-else statement: <br>

                <p>
                    <span>What is an Operating System?</span> <br>
                     A program that acts as an intermediary between a user of a computer and the computer hardware.
                    <br>
                     An operating System is a collection of system programs that together control the operations of a
                    computer
                    system. <br>
                    Some examples of operating systems are UNIX, Mach, MS-DOS, MS-Windows, Windows/NT, Chicago, OS/2,
                    MacOS, VMS, MVS, and VM.
                    <span>Operating system goals:</span> <br>
                     Execute user programs and make solving user problems easier. <br>
                     Make the computer system convenient to use. <br>
                     Use the computer hardware in an efficient manner. <br>
                    <span>Computer System Components </span> <br>
                    1. Hardware – provides basic computing resources (CPU, memory, I/O devices). <br>
                    2. Operating system – controls and coordinates the use of the hardware among the various application
                    programs for the various users. <br>
                    3. Applications programs – Define the ways in which the system resources are used to solve the
                    computing
                    problems of the users (compilers, database systems, video games, business programs). <br>
                    4. Users (people, machines, other computers). <br>

                    <span>Functions of Operating System:</span> <br>
                    <span> Process Management</span> <br>
                    A process is a program in execution. A process needs certain resources, including CPU time, memory,
                    files, and I/O devices, to accomplish its task.
                    The operating system is responsible for the following activities in connection with process
                    management. <br>
                    ✦ Process creation and deletion. <br>
                    ✦ process suspension and resumption. <br>
                    ✦ Provision of mechanisms for: <br>
                     process synchronization <br>
                     process communication <br>
                    <span>Main-Memory Management</span> <br>
                    Memory is a large array of words or bytes, each with its own address. It is a repository of quickly
                    accessible data shared by the CPU and I/O devices. <br>
                    Main memory is a volatile storage device. It loses its contents in the case of system failure. <br>
                    The operating system is responsible for the following activities in connections with memory
                    management: <br>
                     Keep track of which parts of memory are currently being used and by whom. <br>
                     Decide which processes to load when memory space becomes available. <br>
                     Allocate and de-allocate memory space as needed. <br>
                    <span>File Management</span> <br>
                    A file is a collection of related information defined by its creator. Commonly, files represent
                    programs
                    (both source and object forms) and data. <br>
                    The operating system is responsible for the following activities in connections with file
                    management: <br>
                    ✦ File creation and deletion. <br>
                    ✦ Directory creation and deletion. <br>
                    ✦ Support of primitives for manipulating files and directories. <br>
                    ✦ Mapping files onto secondary storage. <br>
                    ✦ File backup on stable (nonvolatile) storage media. <br>
                    <span>I/O System Management</span> <br>
                    The I/O system consists of: <br>
                    ✦ A buffer-caching system <br>
                    ✦ A general device-driver interface <br>
                    ✦ Drivers for specific hardware devices <br>
                    <span> Secondary-Storage Management</span>
                    Since main memory (primary storage) is volatile and too small to accommodate all data and programs
                    permanently, the computer system must provide secondary storage to back up main memory. <br>
                    Most modern computer systems use disks as the principle on-line storage medium, for both programs
                    and data. <br>
                    The operating system is responsible for the following activities in connection with disk management:
                    <br>
                    ✦ Free space management <br>
                    ✦ Storage allocation <br>
                    ✦ Disk scheduling <br>
                    <span>Networking (Distributed Systems)</span> <br>
                     A distributed system is a collection processors that do not share memory or a clock. Each
                    processor has
                    its own local memory. <br>
                     The processors in the system are connected through a communication network. <br>
                     Communication takes place using a protocol. <br>
                     A distributed system provides user access to various system resources. <br>
                     Access to a shared resource allows: <br>
                    ✦ Computation speed-up <br>


                    ✦ Increased data availability <br>
                    ✦ Enhanced reliability <br>

                    ✦ Increased data availability <br>
                    ✦ Enhanced reliability <br>
